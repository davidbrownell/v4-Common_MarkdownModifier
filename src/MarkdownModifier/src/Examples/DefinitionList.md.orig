## Samples

### Standard
- I drink coffee in the morning.
- I have milk with my cereal.
- Water is good any time of the day.
- I drink Gatorade when I play sports, but that doesn't happen too often anymore.

### Case Sensitivity

- Coffee, coffee
- Milk, milk
- Water, water
- Gatorade, gatorade (the latter will not be matched because `postprocess_type` is set to `DefinitionList.PostprocessType.Exact`)

### Stemming

- Milk, milks, milked, milking
- Water, waters, watered, watering
- Gatorade, Gatorades (only the exact match will be decorated because `postprocess_type` is set to `DefinitionList.PostprocessType.Exact`)
